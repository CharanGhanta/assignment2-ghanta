### Code Fencing

> The dot (or scalar) product a⋅b for vectors a and b can be defined in two identical ways. Geometrically it is product of the length of the first vector by the length of the projection of the second vector onto the first one. As you may see from the image below this projection is nothing but |a|cosθ where θ is the angle between a and b. Thus a⋅b=|a|cosθ⋅|b|.
